### What is it?
99 Bottles is a new, innovative piece of software. We aim to create an answer to the age old computer science question, *"Is it possible to make a program that writes out the lyrics to 99 bottles of beer on the wall, and if so how do we do it"*. 

The answer is yes, we can, and the way we do it is using *advanced, high level algorithms* and *mathmatics* to come up with the most amazing programming feat since the invention of binary.

Not only this, but we offer this code **free and open source**, available to all end users on all platform's that can install python3.

We also aim to provide a simple and userfriendly experience for all users, young and old. We do so by provided a state of the art config system, with easy to manage and well documented variables that let you control almost every part of our program.

### It's a *Module*
Our code is also useable as a module system for our fellow devs. Have you, mr/mrs software developer, ever said to yourself *"darn, this is some really good code I've just written here, if only there was a simple and easy to use function that would allow me to print out the entire lyrics to 99 bottles of beer on the wall, with a spesific delay and starting point"*, well now you can, simply add our module and its config to your existing python code, import it into your file and bazinga, you have a function that does exactly what you want it to do.

### Future plans
---

99 Bottles is an ongoing development and we have a clear and in depth plan for upcoming updates to the code, which will be provided free to the public.

In future, 99 Bottles will do the following:

* ~~Throw an error if you put a negative number into the config file~~ Completed!
* Output in text to speech as well as text, for the hearing impaired
* Provide dynamic delays that will take into account the length of the numbers
* Cure Cancer

All of these updates are *guaranteed** **and absolutely free**!


*terms and conditions apply, see in store for details
